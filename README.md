# db9-adapter
An adapter for male and female DB9 connections

This adapter uses a standard DB9 male or female connector and two 5 position screw terminals to create a breakout for a serial or any other connection on a DB9. RS-232 signals are named for convenience, but that doesn't mean that's your only option.

Use the side marked 'M' for a male DB9, or the side marked 'F' for a female DB9.
